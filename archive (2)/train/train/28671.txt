Janya Ragas are Carnatic music ragas derived from the fundamental set of 72 ragas called Melakarta ragas, by the permutation and combination of the various ascending and descending notes. The process of deriving janya ragas from the parent melakartas is complex and leads to an open mathematical possibility of around thirty thousand ragas. Although limited by the necessity of the existence of individual swaroopas for the janya ragas, a list is never comprehensive or exhaustive. Thus the list below is open to more additions/corrections. Moreover, some musicians experiment and use new scales which had not been used before, leading to new janya ragas.
The melakartas are listed by numbers 1-72, with corresponding asampoorna melakarta names and scales listed just below . Under those musical scales are the janyas associated with each melakarta. If the raga has multiple scales in the same janya, these are given below the main scale. Other janya ragas that are either not associated with a melakarta or whose scales are not yet added in this list, are listed at the bottom.
